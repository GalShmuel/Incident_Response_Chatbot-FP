# Incident Response Chatbot (Final Project)

A chatbot designed to assist with incident response — simulating interactions, gathering information, and guiding users through security incident workflows.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project is a full-stack chatbot system built for incident response scenarios. It’s composed of a **frontend** (user interface) and a **backend** (logic, data management, and integrations). The chatbot can be used for training, simulation, or real incident documentation.

**Key goals:**
- Simulate realistic security incident conversations  
- Help users document and triage incidents  
- Enable integrations with incident management systems or databases  
- Provide a platform for security teams to train on IR processes  

---

## 🔧 Architecture & Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + JavaScript  
- **Backend**: Node.js  
- **Data Storage / Logic**: Your backend handles incident flow, storage, and possibly AI / decision rules  
- **Dependencies**: Defined in `package.json` (frontend) and backend folder
